'''
This script takes a folder of images and creates a video from them. The finished video
is placed in the same folder as the images.

The expected format of the image names is `FRAME#_SEC_NANOSEC.jpg` an example is:
    `000125_1670443549_590421097.jpg`

Files are sorted based on their frame number.
